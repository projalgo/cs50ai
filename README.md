                        dataset, which contains thousands of images of 43 different kinds of road signs. 🚨</dl>

<code>Panser</code> <dl>A common task in natural language processing is parsing🚧, the process of determining the structure of a sentence. The rule S -> N V, for example, means that the S symbol can be rewritten as N V (a noun followed by a verb). 
                        If we also have the rule N -> "Holmes" and the rule V -> "sat", we can generate the complete sentence "Holmes sat.".</dl>
